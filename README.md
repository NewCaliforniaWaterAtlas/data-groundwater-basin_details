# California Groundwater Basins Dataset - Version 0.0.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. We will note when this document is final. 7/26/2013 -- laci videmsky

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) maintains a dataset of groundwater elevation data, and makes it available through their data and mapping portal "California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring (CASGEM)"

We are working to create a dataset that is developer-friendly, accurate, up-to-date and well-documented. We believe this will help to speed communication and promote clarity and innovation about water usage in the State. We began in December 2012, and are doing more improvements in Summer 2013. Please watch this Github repository for updates. We would like to have a great & re-usable dataset worked out by January 2014.

Groundwater Basin Descriptions


From the California Department of Water Resources's description of this data:

"Out of 431 delineated groundwater basins, 24 basins are subdivided to create an additional 108 subbasins. These 515 distinct groundwater systems underlie about 40 percent of the surface area of the State."

"Many of the subbasin boundaries were developed or modified with public input, but little physical data. Because they should not be considered precise boundaries, a detailed local study should determine whether any specific area lies within a groundwater basin boundary."

PDFs of each groundwater basin and sub-basin can be found on DWR's site here:
