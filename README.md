Groundwater Basin Descriptions


From the California Department of Water Resources's description of this data:

"Out of 431 delineated groundwater basins, 24 basins are subdivided to create an additional 108 subbasins. These 515 distinct groundwater systems underlie about 40 percent of the surface area of the State."

"Many of the subbasin boundaries were developed or modified with public input, but little physical data. Because they should not be considered precise boundaries, a detailed local study should determine whether any specific area lies within a groundwater basin boundary."

PDFs of each groundwater basin and sub-basin can be found on DWR's site here:
